            <h3>About Thala</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Dhoni was born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) in a Hindu
                 Rajput family to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.His parents hailed from Lwali
                  village in Uttar Pradesh (now Uttarakhand) and he was the youngest of three children.
                    <br><br>
                Dhoni did his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir where he started playing football as a 
                goal keeper but later moved to play cricket on the suggestion of his coach Keshav Banerjee. 
                From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur under South Eastern
                 Railway zone of Indian Railways.
                <br><br>
                Dhoni married Sakshi Singh Rawat on 4 July 2010 in Dehradun.Dhoni and his wife have a daughter
                 who was born on 6 February 2015.He lives in his farmhouse outside Ranchi.Dhoni is an automotive
                  enthusiast and owns a number of bikes and cars in his collection.
                  <br><br><br>
                  Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket on 15 August 2020 as he had not played any international 
                      cricket since India's loss in the 2019 world cup semi-final.[116]</p>

            <h3>Playing Style</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper.Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman who deviates 
                from conventional coaching manuals to showcase his batting technique.Dhoni displays a proclivity
                 for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the
                  conventional Cover region. He plays pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries often 
                  putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly. Dhoni holds the bat with a
                   firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary.
                    He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.
                   He plays the helicopter shot technique, taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.
                    As a batsman, he is recognized for his finishing skills in high-pressure situations.
                    <br><br>
                As a wicket-keeper, he has been praised for his fast reflexes behind the stumps while also being criticized
                 for the lack of good technique.He is known for his unorthodox captaincy, approachability and has
                  earned a reputation of being a successful leader.Dhoni is also known for his cool-headed demeanor
                   on the field which has earned him the monicker "Captain cool".</p>
